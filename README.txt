First, in order to run setup file and for the tool to work you need to install Python.
(preferably the latest stable version)

For Windows download installer from the link: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

For Linux run the command:
sudo apt install python3


**NOTE**:
When installing Nvidia package, when running the app module pynvml (Python nvidia module) is not found, type this command:
pip install --ignore-installed nvidia-ml-py

After that, app should work just fine!
